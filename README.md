42 2019 - DataScience Project

### What is DSLR

DataScience x Logistic Regression, this project goal is following the Linear Regression one, to keep exploring the Machine Learning adding new tools and knowledge.

This project is an introduction to DataScience, It's goal is to help you visualizating data and having a better knowledege of it before putting it into a machine learning algorithm.

## Running the tests

My project mark is : 120/100

If you want to test the project, you just have to


```
You'll just have to run the different script making sure you have the datasets files.
Watchout, python3's latest version, numpy, matplotlib may be required to launch the different executables.
